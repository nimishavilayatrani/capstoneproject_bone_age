# capstoneproject_bone_age
This repository will contain all information from where the input taken, model preparation and required framework for this project.
# Overview
This project involves developing a model to predict bone age from medical images. The work was initiated with input from Prof. Dr. Christoph M. Friedrich and access to the university server provided by Ralf Weidemann. All computations and model training were performed on the university's Jupyter Notebook server.
Project Details
Project Notebook: capstoneproject_bone_age.ipynb
Analysis Report: Included in both DOCX and PDF formats.
Dataset: The validation and training datasets are uploaded on Google Drive.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kGdXTycahRrXLsjcvQjFrF2TJjPe5szR?usp=sharing The link to these datasets is shared in the project documentation.
# YOLO Framework Setup:
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 ~/yolov5
after conversion with this framework the both csv train.csv and test.csv is shared in the project 
# Requirements
The requirements.txt file, generated using pip freeze, lists all the dependencies needed to run the project. To install these dependencies, use the following command:
Analysis Report
The analysis report contains detailed information about the dataset, the model training process, evaluation metrics, and conclusions. Screenshots of the Jupyter Notebook cells and outputs are included for reference. The report is available in both DOCX and PDF formats for ease of access.

# References
The project builds upon previous work, and relevant references and papers are cited in the analysis report. Contributions from ChatGPT and Google were also utilized for various aspects of the project.

# Conclusion
After applying various models, the best-performing model and the corresponding graphs and metrics are documented in the data analysis report. The conclusions drawn from this analysis provide insights into the effectiveness of the models used for bone age prediction.

# Acknowledgments
Prof. Dr. Christoph M. Friedrich: For providing initial input and guidance for the project.
Ralf Weidemann: For granting access to the university server.
ChatGPT and Google: For additional help and resources during the project.
